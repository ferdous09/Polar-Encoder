# Polar Encoder

## This repository contains the code for 5G NR Polar Encoder


* The PolarCoding.m is the main encoder part.
* Polar_Coding_Main.m implements Polar Encoding in 5G NR. 
* The obtained results from the simulator are compared to that of the MATLAB's built-in nrPolarEncode.


Note that most part of these codes are generated following MATLAB's example [5G New Radio Polar Coding](https://www.mathworks.com/help/5g/gs/polar-coding.html) and 3GPPP's specification [TS 38.212](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3214)
